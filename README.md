# boogas-welcome-of-fate
Booga's Welcome of Fate is a Role-Playing game made using Pygame.

This is a game I am making for fun and experience in coding games.
Currently, I am trying to push development until an Alpha version can be released.

In the first version of the Alpha, only the Mage class will be available for play. 
Subsequent versions will include other classes as playable characters.

At this time, the Pygame version of Booga's Welcome of Fate is no longer in development. 
If you would like to stay up to date on the project, please visit the Unity port of the game, which is a fully-fledged 2D action RPG game that retains the elements that make Booga's Welcome of Fate so unique.
