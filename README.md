# boogas-welcome-of-fate
Booga's Welcome of Fate is a Role-Playing game made using Pygame.

This is a game I am making for fun and experience in coding games.
Currently, I am trying to push development until an Alpha version can be released.

In the first version of the Alpha, only the Mage class will be available for play. 
Subsequent versions will include other classes as playable characters.

--- ALPHA COMPLETE --- 
Now working on: the Rouge class
